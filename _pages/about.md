Hi! I‚Äôm Abhinava De, a Ph.D. student in the [Circuits and Security Research Lab](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/csrl/) at the [Department of Electronic Systems Engineering](https://dese.iisc.ac.in/), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.

My current research focuses on the efficient hardware implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) circuits and side-channel resistant cryptographic designs. I aim to develop secure and robust cryptographic hardware capable of withstanding both classical and quantum attacks.

Beyond cryptography, I'm also passionate about building energy-efficient hardware accelerators for machine learning (ML) classifiers, especially for integration in wearable electronics used in real-time, critical physiological signal monitoring, with applications for both patients and athletes.
