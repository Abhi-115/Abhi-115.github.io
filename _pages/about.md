Hi! I’m Abhinava De, a Ph.D. researcher in the Circuits and Security Research Lab at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.

My research focuses on the efficient hardware implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) circuits and side-channel resistant cryptographic designs. I aim to develop secure and robust cryptographic hardware capable of withstanding both classical and quantum attacks.

Beyond cryptography, I'm also passionate about building energy-efficient hardware accelerators for machine learning (ML) classifiers, especially for integration in wearable electronics used in real-time, critical physiological signal monitoring, with applications for both patients and athletes.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, in 2024. My undergraduate thesis was titled “Smart Agreements in the Decentralized P2P Network of Ethereum.”
