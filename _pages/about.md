Hi! I’m Abhinava De, a Ph.D. student in the [Circuits and Security Research Lab](https://labs.dese.iisc.ac.in/csrl/) at the Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.

My research focuses on the efficient hardware implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptographic (PQC) circuits and side-channel resistant cryptographic designs. I aim to develop secure and robust cryptographic hardware capable of withstanding both classical and quantum attacks.

Beyond cryptography, I'm also passionate about building energy-efficient hardware accelerators for machine learning (ML) classifiers, especially for integration in wearable electronics used in real-time, critical physiological signal monitoring, with applications for both patients and athletes.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology (IIEST), Shibpur, in 2024. My undergraduate thesis was titled “Smart Agreements in the Decentralized P2P Network of Ethereum.”

Beyond academics, I am an avid sports fan and actively participate in various outdoor sports such as cricket and football. I was a part of my departmental football team which won the bronze medal in the IISc EECS Sports Meet, 2024 and I have also received formal training in cricket. Furthermore I am also passionate about painting and have received several accolades in drawing competitions, most notably by securing the second position amongst participants from all over my state, in a sit-and-draw drawing competition organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the occassion of World Environment Day, 2012.
