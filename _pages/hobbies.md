<!-- Beyond academics, I am an avid sports fan and actively participate in various outdoor sports such as cricket and football. I was a part of my departmental football team which won the bronze medal in the IISc EECS Sports Meet, 2024 and I have also received formal training in cricket. Furthermore I am also passionate about painting and have received several accolades in drawing competitions, most notably by securing the second position in a state-wide sit-and-draw competition organised by the [Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry](https://bengalchamber.com/) on the occassion of World Environment Day, 2012. -->

Beyond research and academia, I‚Äôm passionate about staying active and involved through sports, art, and other creative pursuits.

### üé® Art
I‚Äôm passionate about painting and have earned accolades in various competitions. One of the memorable moments was securing the second position in a state-level sit-and-draw competition organized by the [Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry](https://bengalchamber.com/) on World Environment Day, 2012.

### üåç Travelling
I love to travel‚Äîespecially to the mountains. Almost every year, I make it a point to head to the Himalayas, where I find a deep sense of peace and connection. So far, I‚Äôve explored the entire Indian Himalayan range, with Kashmir being the only region still on my list. While I do enjoy the serenity of beaches, it‚Äôs the mountains that truly call to me.
