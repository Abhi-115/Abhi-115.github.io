Beyond academics, I am an avid sports fan and actively participate in various outdoor sports such as cricket and football. I was a part of my departmental football team which won the bronze medal in the IISc EECS Sports Meet, 2024 and I have also received formal training in cricket. Furthermore I am also passionate about painting and have received several accolades in drawing competitions, most notably by securing the second position in a state-wide sit-and-draw competition organised by the [Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry](https://bengalchamber.com/) on the occassion of World Environment Day, 2012.

Outside of research, I love staying active through several extra-curricular activities.
